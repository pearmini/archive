- On the internet, nobody knows you are a binary numerical augment not the letter A
- This is a book about the history, politics and computational basics of text-based characters and digital representation of text, from Morse Code to ASCII art to Unicode (and emojis), as well as alternative text encoding schemes.

- Computers can be seen as layers of technology, with increasing complexity and abstraction as they go up. Programming can happen at different layers.
- Merely doing AND/OR operations inside of a logic gate is technically coding
- A language is independent from the circuit of machine, and is automatically translate to lower level instructions by a compiler which most programmers don't interact directly.
- To do this, computers assign sequences of binary code to characters.
- To computer, textual data is also numerical data.
